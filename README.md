## Our team
Our team is composed of young people eager to learn new things about blockchain. Each member of the team has experience in IT, cybersecurity and server deployment. We don't have any plans on revealing our true identity since we think we could be targeted trough our private profiles for the private validator keys and other sensitive informations. Also this informations, in our opinion, are not relevant to the growth of the Terra ecosystem.

We use a sentry architecture with nodes all around the world to ensure maximum uptime and protection from DDoS attacks.

We make governance decisions based on the opinion of our team members and the developers of the blockchain itself, we also discuss them with the delegators in our discord server
